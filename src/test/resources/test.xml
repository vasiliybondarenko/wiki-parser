The '''1994 London Israeli Embassy bombing''' was a car bomb attack on 26 July 1994 against the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli embassy]] building in London. Twenty civilians were injured. A second bomb was exploded outside Balfour House, Finchley, premises occupied by the Jewish Philanthropic Institution for Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;DocNo24&quot;&gt;Yonah Alexander, Edgar H. Brenner (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xyGPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA693 Document No 24], in ''UK's Legal Responses to Terrorism'', Routledge, p. 693&lt;/ref&gt;

== The attack ==
A car packed with 20 to 30 pounds of explosives parked in front of the embassy blew up minutes after the driver left it. The blast, which caused widespread damage, was heard over a mile away. Apart from damage to the embassy building, shop windows were blown out. The attack took place one day after [[King Hussein]] of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] met in Washington to discuss a Jordan-Israel peace treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's London embassy bombed|publisher=BBC|pages=|date=26 July 1994|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_2499000/2499619.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen hours later another car bomb exploded outside [[North Finchley#Balfour House Bombing|Balfour House]], which at the time was the London headquarters of one of the largest Jewish charities, The United Jewish Israel Appeal (UJIA), injuring six.&lt;ref name=&quot;DocNo24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bombing in London Hits Israeli Embassy|publisher=The New York Times|date=27 July 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/world/bombing-in-london-hits-israeli-embassy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Initially, the Israeli ambassador and British intelligence experts were blaming &quot;pro-Iranian extremists, probably linked to the Lebanon-based [[Hezbollah]] group.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; A group calling themselves the Palestinian Resistance Jaffa Group claimed responsibility for both bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;DocNo24&quot;/&gt;

Five [[Palestinians]] were arrested in London in January 1995 in connection with the bombings. In December 1996, two of them, both Palestinian science graduates educated in the UK, [[Jawad Botmeh]] and [[Samar Alami]], were found guilty of &quot;conspiracy to cause explosions&quot; at the [[Old Bailey]]. They were sentenced to 20 years in jail, and lost their appeal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Tally Ho Bombers Lose Court Appeal | newspaper =Guardian.co.uk | pages = | year = | date =1 November 2001| url =http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15117.tally_ho_bombers_lose_court_appeal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botmeh was released from prison in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Metropolitan University suspends researcher with car bomb conviction|publisher=BBC|pages=|date=22 February 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-21545445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
