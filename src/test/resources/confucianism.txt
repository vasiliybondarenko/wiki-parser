'''Confucianism''', also known as '''Ruism''', is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.{{sfnb|Yao|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20religion&amp;f=false 38-47]}} Confucianism developed from what was later called the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] from the teachings of the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the [[Zhou dynasty]] golden age of several centuries before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rickett, Guanzi&quot;&gt;Rickett, Guanzi - &quot;all early Chinese political thinkers were basically committed to a reesteablishment of the golden age of the past as early Zhou propaganda described it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the &quot;proto-Taoist&quot; [[Huang-Lao]], as the official ideology while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]].

A Confucian revival began during the [[Tang dynasty]] of 618-907. In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the [[imperial exams]] and the core philosophy of the [[scholar-officials|scholar official class]] in the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The [[New Culture Movement|New Culture]] intellectuals of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the &quot;[[Three Principles of the People]]&quot; with the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], and then [[Maoism]] under the [[People's Republic of China]]. In the late twentieth century Confucian [[work ethic]] has been credited with the rise of the [[East Asia]]n economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|title=Demystifying the Chinese Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxzJoskK_rwC&amp;pg=PA107|date=27 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521191807|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony, rather than on an otherworldly source of spiritual values,{{sfnb|Fingarette|1972| p = 1-2}} the core of Confucianism is [[humanism|humanistic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer |first= Mark |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location = |isbn = 978-0-19-518835-6 |page = 70 |quote=...humanist philosophies such as Confucianism, which do not share a belief in divine law and do not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herbert Fingarette]]'s concept of &quot;the [[secularity|secular]] as [[sacred]],&quot; Confucianism regards the ordinary activities of human life — and especially in human relationships as a manifestation of the sacred,{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}} because they are the expression of our moral nature (''xìng'' 性), which has a transcendent anchorage in [[Tian|Heaven]] (''Tiān'' 天) and a proper respect for the spirits or gods (''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, 2010. pp. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Tiān'' has some characteristics that overlap the category of deity, it is primarily an ''impersonal'' [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]], like the ''[[Tao|Dào]]'' (道) or the ''[[Brahman]]''. Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the ''Tiān''.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10 quote|ps=: [...] Confucianism is basically ''non-theistic''. While Heaven (''tiān'') has some characteristics that overlap the category of deity, it is primarily an ''impersonal'' absolute, like ''dao'' and ''Brahman''. &quot;Deity&quot; (''theos'', ''deus''), on the other hand connotes something ''personal'' (he or she, not it).}}{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12 quote|ps=: Confucianism deconstructs the sacred-profane dichotomy; it asserts that sacredness is to be found ''in'', not behind or beyond, the ordinary activities of human life — and especially in human relationships. Human relationships are sacred in Confucianism because they are the expression of our moral nature (''xìng'' 性), which has a transcendent anchorage in Heaven (''tiān'' 天). Herbert Fingarette captured this essential feature of Confucianism in the title of his 1972 book, ''Confucius: The Secular as Sacred''. To assume a dualistic relationship between sacred and profane and to use this as a criterion of religion is to beg the question of whether Confucian can count as a religious tradition.}} Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 ''rú'', or sometimes 正統/正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', meaning &quot;[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]&quot; ritual style) led by Confucian priests or &quot;sages of rites&quot; (禮生/礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods in public and ancestral [[Chinese temple]]s is preferred in various occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5&quot;&gt;Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The this-worldly concern of Confucianism rests on the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics. Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', and ''zhì''. ''Rén'' (仁, &quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;humaneness&quot;) is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} ''Yì'' (義/义) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. ''Lǐ'' (禮/礼) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life according to the law of Heaven. ''Zhì'' (智) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of ''rén'' and ''yì''.

Traditionally, cultures and countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland [[culture of China|China]], [[culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[culture of Macau|Macau]], [[culture of Korea|Korea]], [[culture of Japan|Japan]], and [[culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], as well as various territories settled predominantly by [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], such as [[culture of Singapore|Singapore]]. In the 20th century Confucianism's influence diminished greatly. In the last decades there have been talks of a &quot;Confucian Revival&quot; in the academic and the scholarly community&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Elman, John Duncan and Herman Ooms ed. ''Rethinking Confucianism: Past and Present in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam'' (Los Angeles: UCLA Asian Pacific Monograph Series, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu Yingshi, ''Xiandai Ruxue Lun'' (River Edge: Global Publishing Co. Inc. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been a grassroots proliferation of various types of [[Confucian churches]].{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=passim}} In late 2015 [[Holy Confucian Church#founding members|many Confucian personalities]] formally established a national [[Holy Confucian Church]] (孔聖會/孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì'') in China to unify the many Confucian congregations and civil society organisations.

==Names and terminology==
[[File:Konfuzius-1770.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Confucius]], painting from circa 1770.]]
Strictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to &quot;Confucianism.&quot; In the Chinese language, the character ''rú'' 儒 meaning &quot;scholar&quot; or &quot;learned man&quot; is generally used both in the past and the present to refer to things related to Confucianism. The character ''rú'' in ancient China has diverse meanings. Some examples include, &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;soft,&quot; &quot;to tame,&quot; &quot;to comfort&quot; and &quot;to educate&quot; or &quot;to refine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eno, ''The Confucian Creation of Heaven: philosophy and the defense of ritual mastery'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990), 190–197.&lt;/ref&gt; Several different terms are used in different situations, several of which are of modern origin:
* &quot;Refined school&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}})
* &quot;Refined doctrine&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Rújiào}})
* &quot;Refined studies&quot; ({{cjkv|t=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:學|學]]|s=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:学|学]]|p=Rúxué}})
* &quot;Confucius' teaching&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Kǒngjiào}})
* &quot;Kong family business&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:家|家]][[wikt:店|店]]|p=Kǒngjiādiàn}}) A pejorative phrase used in the [[New Culture Movement]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].

Three of these use ''rú''. These names do not use the name &quot;Confucius&quot; at all, but instead center on the figure or ideal of the Confucian scholar; however, the suffixes ''jiā'', ''jiào'' and ''xué'' carry different implications as to the nature of Confucianism itself.

''Rújiā'' contains the character ''jiā'', which often means &quot;family,&quot; but here is &quot;school of thought.&quot;

''Rújiào'' and ''Kǒngjiào'' contain the Chinese character ''jiào'', the noun &quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;transmission,&quot; used in such terms as &quot;education,&quot; or &quot;educator.&quot; The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ''jiào''.

''Rúxué'' contains ''xué'', &quot;study.&quot; The term is parallel to &quot;-ology&quot; in English, being used to construct the names of academic fields: the Chinese names of fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, political science, economics, and sociology all end in ''xué''.

The use of the term Confucianism has been avoided by some modern scholars, who favor ''Ruism'' or ''Ruists'' in lieu of Confucianism. Robert Eno argues that the term has been &quot;burdened... with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations.&quot; Ruism, as he states, is more faithful to the original Chinese name for the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eno&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Eno|title=The Confucian Creation of Heaven: Philosophy and the Defense of Ritual Mastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUu74rOOWy8C&amp;pg=PA7|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0208-6|page=7|quote=it will be best for us to relinquish entirely the term &quot;Confucian.&quot;.. their philosophy we will call &quot;Ruism&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five Classics (五经, ''Wǔjīng'') and the Confucian vision===
Traditionally, Confucius was thought to be the author or editor of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Classics]] which were the basic texts of Confucianism. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao|Yáo Xīnzhōng]] allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that “nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics.” Yáo reports that perhaps most scholars today hold the “pragmatic” view that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics, “contributed to their formation.” In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these texts. {{sfnb|Yao|2000|p=52-54}}

The scholar [[Tu Weiming]] explains these classics as embodying “five visions&quot; which underlie the development of Confucianism:
* [[I Ching]] or [[Classic of Change]] or ''Book of Changes,'' generally held to be the earliest of the classics, shows a metaphysical vision which combines divinatory art with numerological technique and ethical insight; philosophy of change sees cosmos as interaction between the two energies yin and yang, universe always shows organismic unity and dynamism.
* [[Classic of Poetry]]  or ''Book of Songs'' is the earliest anthology of [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] and songs. It shows the poetic vision in the belief that poetry and music convey common human feelings and mutual responsiveness.
* [[Book of Documents]] or ''Book of History'' Compilation of speeches of major figures and records of events in ancient times embodies the political vision and addresses the kingly way in terms of the ethical foundation for humane government. The documents show the sagacity, filial piety, and work ethic of Yao, Shun, and Yu. They established a political culture which was based on responsibility and trust. Their virtue formed a covenant of social harmony  which did not depend on punishment or coercion.
* [[Book of Rites]] describes the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou Dynasty. This social vision defined society not as an adversarial system based on contractual relations but as a community of trust based on social responsibility. The [[Four occupations|four functional occupations]] are cooperative (farmer, scholar, artisan, merchant).
* [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] chronicles the period to which it gives its name, [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BCE) and these events emphasize the significance of collective memory for communal self-identification, for reanimating the old is the best way to attain the new.&lt;ref&gt;Tu Wei-ming: &quot;The Confucian Tradition in Chinese History,&quot; in Paul S. Ropp, ed., ''The Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization''.  (Berkeley; Oxford:University of California Press,  1990), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory and theology===
{{Further information|Confucian theology}}
Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the self and ''[[Tian|Tiān]]'' ([[Heaven]], or the traditional high god of the Zhou), and the relationship of humankind to the Heaven.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}}{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''Tiān lǐ'' 天理 or ''[[Tao|Dào]]'' 道), is the order of the creation and divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure. Individuals can realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order. This transformation of the self can be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}}

The moral-spiritual ideal of Confucianism conciles both the inner and outer polarities of self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of &quot;sageliness within and kingliness without.&quot;{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} ''Rén'', translated as &quot;humaneness&quot; or the essence proper of a human being, is the character of compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man can achieve oneness with Heaven or return to Heaven, or comprehend his divine nature. In the ''Dàtóng shū'' (《大同書/大同书》) it is defined as &quot;to form one body with all things&quot; and &quot;when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused.&quot;{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}

====''Tiān'' and the gods====
[[File:天-oracle.svg|250px|thumb|right|[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou period]] [[oracle bone script]] for ''Tian''.]]
{{Main article|Tian}}
''Tiān'' (天), a key concept in Chinese thought, refers to the sky, or the [[heaven]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kurtis Hagen. [http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_tian.html Confucian Key Terms - Tian 天] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203164801/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_tian.html |date=3 December 2014 }}. plattsburgh.edu&lt;/ref&gt; nature, &quot;heaven and earth&quot; (that is, &quot;all things&quot;), and to the awe-inspiring forces beyond human control. There are such a number of uses in Chinese thought that it is not possible to give one translation into English.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 35}}

Confucius used the term in a religious way. He wrote in the ''Analects''  (7.23) that Tian gave him life, and that Tian watched and judged. (6.28; 9.12). A person can know the movement of the Tiān, giving the sense of having a special place in the universe. (9.5) Confucius wrote that Tian spoke to him, though not in words (17.19), but the scholar Ronnie Littlejohn warns that Tian was not a personal God comparable to the [[God]] of the Abrahamic faiths in the sense of an independent creator or transcendent Being.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 35-36}} When Confucians spoke of Tian they often meant  something like what the [[Taoists]] meant by ''[[Tao]]'' (Dào): &quot;the way things are&quot; or &quot;the regularities of the world.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Kurtis Hagen. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160420204545/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_dao.html Confucian Key Terms - Dao 道]. plattsburgh.edu&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Tiān'' can also be compared to the ''[[Brahman]]'' of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Veda|Vedic]] traditions.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}}

[[Duanmu Ci|Zǐgòng]], a disciple of Confucius, said that Tiān had set the master on the path to become a wise man (''Analects'' 9.6). In ''Analects'' 7.23 Confucius says that he has no doubt left that the Tiān gave him life, and from it he had developed the virtue (Dé, 德). In ''Analects'' 8.19 he says that the lives of the sages and their communion with Tian are interwoven.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 35}}

Regarding personal [[deity|gods]] (''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', energies who emanate from and reproduce the ''Tiān'') enliving nature, in ''Analects'' 6.22 Confucius says that it is appropriate (義/义, ''yì'') for people to worship (敬, ''jìng'') them,{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 36}} though through proper [[rite]]s (禮/礼, ''lǐ''), implying respect of positions and discretion.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 36}} Confucius himself was a ritual and [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] master.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 37}} In ''Analects'' 3.12 he explains that religious rituals produce meaningful experiences.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 36-37}} Rites and sacrifices to the gods have an [[ethics|ethical]] importance: they generate good life, because taking part in them leads to the overcoming of the self.{{refn|group=note|Quote: «Confucius placed strong emphasis on the importance of rites for the individual who wishes to live the good life. He maintains that &quot;benevolence (仁, ''rén'') is constituted by returning to the observance of the rites through overcoming of the self&quot; (''Analects'' 12:1, Lau: 112). [...] Confucius holds that these rites have an ethical dimension [...] But in order to live as one should, it is not enough to follow or perform these rites—rather these rites should be lived out. Confucius holds that, when one sacrifices to the gods, one must sacrifice as if the gods are present (''Analects'' 3:12, Lau: 69). It is not enough to perform the sacrifice, one must take part in it.»&lt;ref&gt;Qingsong Shen, Kwong-loi Shun, 2007. pp. 278-279&lt;/ref&gt;}} Analects 10.11 tells that Confucius always took a small part of his food and placed it on the sacrificial bowls as an offering to his [[ancestor]]s.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p = 37}}

In original Confucianism the concept of Tiān expresses a form of [[pantheism]]. Other philosophical currents, like [[Mohism]], developed a more [[theism|theistic]] idea of the Tiān.&lt;ref&gt;Homer Dubs. ''Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy''. In: ''Philosophy of East and West'', vol. 9, n. 3/4, pp 163-172. University of Hawaii Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
[[File:Famous Confucian Statue of the Ashikaga Gakko.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Confucius]] and disciples, statues of the [[Ashikaga Gakko]], a Confucian school and oldest academy of [[Japan]].]]
Confucian ethics are described as [[humanism|humanistic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;/&gt; This ethical philosophy can be practiced by all the members of a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;bevir1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bevir|2010|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucian ethics is characterized by the promotion of virtues, encompassed by the Five Constants, or the ''wǔ cháng'' (五常), extrapolated by Confucian scholars during the [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;runes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy|last=Runes|first=Dagobert D. |year=1983|publisher=Philosophical Library|location= |isbn= 978-0-8022-2388-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Five Constants are:&lt;ref name=&quot;runes&quot;/&gt;
*''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' (仁, benevolence, humaneness);
*''[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yì]]'' (義/义, righteousness or justice);
*''[[Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ]]'' (禮/礼, proper rite);
*''Zhì'' (智, knowledge);
*''Xìn'' (信, integrity).

These are accompanied by the classical ''Sìzì'' (四字), that singles out four virtues, one of which is included among the Five Constants:
*''Zhōng'' (忠, loyalty);
*''[[Xiào]]'' (孝, filial piety);
*''Jié'' (節/节, contingency);
*''Yì'' (義/义, righteousness).

There are still many other elements, such as ''chéng'' (誠/诚, honesty), ''shù'' (恕, kindness and forgiveness), ''lián'' (廉, honesty and cleanness), ''chǐ'' (恥/耻, shame, judge and sense of right and wrong), ''yǒng'' (勇, bravery), ''wēn'' (溫/温, kind and gentle), ''liáng'' (良, good, kindhearted), ''gōng'' (恭, respectful, reverent), ''jiǎn'' (儉/俭, frugal), ''ràng'' (讓/让, modestly, self-effacing).

====Humaneness====
{{Main article|Ren (Confucianism)}}
''Rén'' ({{zh|c=仁}}) is the Confucian virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being [[altruistic]]. It is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the essence of the human being, endowed by Heaven, and at the same time the means by which man can act according to the principle of Heaven (天理, ''Tiān lǐ'') and become one with it.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}

[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yán Huí]], Confucius's most outstanding student, once asked his master to describe the rules of ''rén'' and Confucius replied, &quot;one should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Analects 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also defined ''rén'' in the following way: &quot;wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 雍也 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning of ''rén'' is &quot;not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yan-yuan/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 顏淵 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also said, &quot;''rén'' is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it.&quot; ''Rén'' is close to man and never leaves him.

====Rite, right====
[[File:Korean Confucianism-Chugyedaeje-02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Korean Confucianism|Korean Confucian]] rite in [[Jeju Province|Jeju]].]]
{{Main article|Li (Confucianism)}}
''Li'' (禮/礼) is a classical Chinese word which finds its most extensive use in [[Confucian]] and post-Confucian [[Chinese philosophy]]. ''Li'' is variously translated as &quot;[[rite]]&quot; or &quot;[[reason]],&quot; &quot;ratio&quot; in the pure sense of [[Veda|Vedic]] ''[[ṛta]]'' (&quot;right,&quot; &quot;order&quot;) when referring to the [[cosmos|cosmic]] law, but when referring to its realisation in the context of human individual and social behavior it has also been translated as &quot;[[convention (norm)|custom]],&quot; &quot;[[mores]],&quot; and &quot;rules,&quot; among other terms.

''Li'' embodies the entire web of interaction between humanity, human objects, and nature. Confucius includes in his discussions of ''li'' such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] cites &quot;songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation... rice and millet, fish and meat... the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes... spacious rooms and secluded halls, soft mats, couches and benches&quot; as vital parts of the fabric of ''li''.

Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of ''li''. Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of all human beings with learning ''li'' as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on ''li'' and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.

====Loyalty====
Loyalty ({{zh|c=忠}}, ''zhōng'') is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the most important way for an ambitious young scholar to become a prominent official was to enter a ruler's civil service.

Confucius himself did not propose that &quot;might makes right,&quot; but rather that a superior should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude. In addition, loyalty does not mean subservience to authority. This is because reciprocity is demanded from the superior as well. As Confucius stated &quot;a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness (loyalty).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/ba-yi|title=The Analects : Ba Yi - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Mencius]] also said that &quot;when the prince regards his ministers as his hands and feet, his ministers regard their prince as their belly and heart; when he regards them as his dogs and horses, they regard him as another man; when he regards them as the ground or as grass, they regard him as a robber and an enemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mengzi/li-lou-ii|title=Mengzi : Li Lou II - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mencius indicated that if the ruler is incompetent, he should be replaced. If the ruler is evil, then the people have the right to overthrow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mengzi/liang-hui-wang-ii/zh?en=on|title=孟子 : 梁惠王下 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good Confucian is also expected to remonstrate with his superiors when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/xian-wen/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 憲問 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a proper Confucian ruler should also accept his ministers' advice, as this will help him govern the realm better.

In later ages, however, emphasis was often placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled. Like filial piety, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes in China. Nonetheless, throughout the ages, many Confucians continued to fight against unrighteous superiors and rulers. Many of these Confucians suffered and sometimes died because of their conviction and action.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Hai Rui 海瑞 in the Ming dynasty, Yuan Chang 袁昶 in the Qing and so forth.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ming-Qing era, prominent Confucians such as Wang Yangming promoted individuality and independent thinking as a counterweight to subservience to authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Yangming, Instructions for Practical Living and Other Neo-Confucian Writings by Wang Yang-Ming, Wing-tsit Chan tran. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous thinker Huang Zongxi also strongly criticized the autocratic nature of the imperial system and wanted to keep imperial power in check.&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore De Bary, Waiting for the Dawn: A Plan for the Prince (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 91–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Confucians also realized that loyalty and filial piety have the potential of coming into conflict with one another. This can be true especially in times of social chaos, such as during the period of the Ming-Qing transition.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in 何冠彪 He Guanbiao, ''生與死 : 明季士大夫的抉擇'' (Taipei: Lianjing Chuban Shiye Gongsi, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filial piety====
[[File:尝粪心忧.JPG|thumb|250px|Fourteenth of ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'']]
{{Main article|Filial piety}}
In Confucian philosophy, filial piety ({{zh|c=孝}}, ''xiào'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors. The Confucian classic [[Xiao Jing]] or ''Classic of Xiào'', thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of ''xiào'' / &quot;filial piety.&quot; The book, a conversation between Confucius and his student Zeng Shen (曾參, also known as [[Zengzi]] 曾子), is about how to set up a good society using the principle of ''xiào'' (filial piety). The term can also be applied to general obedience, and is used in religious titles in Christian Churches, like &quot;filial priest&quot; or &quot;filial vicar&quot; for a cleric whose church is subordinate to a larger parish. Filial piety is central to Confucian [[role ethics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, filial [[piety]] means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be [[rebellious]]; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness, for blindly following the parents' wishes is not considered to be ''xiao''; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'' (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:二十四孝|二十四孝]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Social harmony results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the natural order, and playing his or her part well. When Duke Jing of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, [[Confucius]] replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (''Analects'' XII, 11, trans. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Particular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. The same is true with the husband and wife relationship where the husband needs to show benevolence towards his wife and the wife needs to respect the husband in return. This theme of mutuality still exists in East Asian cultures even to this day.

The Five Bonds are: ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, friend to friend. Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties are also extended to the dead, where the living stand as sons to their deceased family. The only relationship where respect for elders isn't stressed was the friend to friend relationship, where mutual equal respect is emphasized instead. In all other relationships, high reverence is usually held for elders.

===''Junzi''===
{{Main article|Junzi}}
The ''junzi'' ({{zh|c=君子}}, ''jūnzǐ'', &quot;[[prince|lord's son]]&quot;) is a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] term often translated as &quot;[[gentleman]]&quot; or &quot;superior person&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes &quot;exemplary person.&quot; Roger T. Ames and Henry Rosemont, Jr., ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation''. Paul Goldin translates it &quot;noble man&quot; in an attempt to capture both its early political and later moral meaning. Cf. &quot;[http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html Confucian Key Terms: Junzi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520073016/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html |date=20 May 2014 }}.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and employed by [[Confucius]] in his works to describe the ideal man. In the ''[[I Ching]]'' it is used by the [[King Wen of Zhou|Duke of Wen]].

In Confucianism, the sage or wise is the ideal personality; however, it is very hard to become one of them. Confucius created the model of ''junzi'', gentleman, which can be achieved by any individual. Later, [[Zhu Xi]] defined ''junzi'' as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of the ''junzi'': he can live in [[poverty]], he does more and speaks less, he is [[loyalty|loyal]], obedient and knowledgeable. The ''junzi'' disciplines himself. ''Ren'' is fundamental to become a ''junzi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx 君子——儒学的理想人格] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418015158/http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx |date=18 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the ''junzi'' sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself can become a ''junzi''.

On the contrary, the ''xiaoren'' (小人, ''xiăorén'', &quot;small or petty person&quot;) does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is [[egotistic]] and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by ''xiaoren'' as opposed to ''junzi'', his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such ''xiaoren'' individuals can range from those who continually indulge in sensual and [[emotion]]al pleasures all day to the [[politician]] who is interested merely in [[power (social and political)|power]] and [[celebrity|fame]]; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.

The ''junzi'' enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure [[virtue]] would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that the government behaves much like a [[family]], the ''junzi'' being a beacon of filial piety.

===Rectification of names===
[[File:Tablet of Confucius.jpg|thumb|250px|Priest paying homage to Confucius' tablet, circa 1900.]]
{{Main article|Rectification of names}}
Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with [[reality]]. Fundamentally, then, social disorder can stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was ''zhèngmíng'' ({{zh|c=[正名]|p=zhèngmíng|l=rectification of terms}}). He gave an explanation of ''zhengming'' to one of his disciples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zi-lu said, &quot;The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master replied, &quot;What is necessary to rectify names.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;So! indeed!&quot; said Zi-lu. &quot;You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master said, &quot;How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man [Junzi] cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''Analects'' XIII, 3, tr. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xun Zi]] chapter (22) &quot;On the Rectification of Names&quot; claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ({{zh|c=[名]|p=míng}}) that directly corresponded with actualities ({{zh|c=[實]|p=shí}}), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong. Since [[harmonious society|social harmony]] is of utmost importance, without the proper rectification of names, society would essentially crumble and &quot;undertakings [would] not [be] completed.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Rodney L.|last2=Choy|first2=Howard|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|edition=1|volume=1|location=New York|publisher= The Rosen Group, Incorporated|year= 2003|pages= 48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Confucianism can be traced even before the birth of its namesake, [[Confucius]] (an Anglicization of his actual name, Kong Qiu), to the general culture of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], which emphasized politeness and consideration, though generally with more of a spiritual bent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/confucianism-definition-beliefs-history.html|title=Confucianism: Definition, Beliefs &amp; History|work=Study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thought to be a real historic figure, Confucius was born on September 28, 551 BC. He reportedly grew up in a time of instability in the region that would someday be known as China, and failed in his ambitions to become a high minister of the national government. But he did become known for his attempts to analyze and codify rules of society and behavior. The system of &quot;virtue&quot; he proposed was one of respect for others, including for their position in society, focusing on this as a system of principles, not mysticism.

The Analects that are generally attributed to Confucius actually appear to have been compiled after his death, by followers one or two generations removed, perhaps during the [[Warring States period]] (476 BC-221 BC), though no copies exist older than 50 BC, with some scholars saying the document may have been compiled as recently as 140 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Els 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism went through a number of phases of being repressed or unpopular, as in the earlier part of the [[Han dynasty]], or being tolerated, even accepted, with the later Han years being an example of this. It is not until the 12th century AD, though, that it has become such an accepted part of the state that the Analects themselves are integrated into civil service tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|author=Cristian Violatti|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, this success came via [[Neo-Confucianism]], an attempt to reform the philosophy, which had been influenced by [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] and was seen as moving toward [[mysticism]] and superstition. This movement started as early as the 8th century AD, and was dominant by the 12th. While still influenced by Taoism and Buddhism, it worked to restore Confucianism to what were seen as its secular roots.

The influence of Confucianism increased after the conquest of the region by the [[Mongol]] empire, whose [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were convinced to adopt its philosophy for their own government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chosonkorea.org/index.php/confucianism/east-asia-in-the-context-of-confucianism/the-origin-of-confucianism|title=The Origin of Confucianism - CHOSON ARCHIVES|author=Super User|work=chosonkorea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2000s, some intellectuals and students in China have become increasingly identified with Confucianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang2010&quot;&gt;Fenggang Yang. ''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-LdyJdpkQ8kJ:www.purdue.edu/crcs/itemPublications/articles/YangChina2020s.pdf+confucian+fundamentalism&amp;hl=it&amp;gl=it&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESize70WNJxoIIOMRBt5DEIi_y2d7zHRgHs0t1XQiaSfoaxX05HWwV5f9yKrIVmFA_nmDge95VJc6DFPpZgQfF23oBelDF6eIoOg7iKV_1cJMVWChRZTQ-uA3FSEby7dk4i5t1Nd&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8emeoEif5P2Tuv3SApNEJDQLzNw Cultural Dynamics in China: Today and in 2020]''. On: ''Asia Policy'', Number 4. July 2007. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people through standardization and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang2010&quot;/&gt; Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a [[state church]] is Jiang Qing.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}}

In 2005 the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang2010&quot;/&gt; and ''[[guoxue]]'' education started to be implemented in public schools. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers have appeared on television since 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang2010&quot;/&gt; The most enthusiastic New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang2010&quot;/&gt;

The idea of a &quot;[[Confucian Church]]&quot; as the [[state religion]] of [[China]] has roots in the thought of [[Kang Youwei]], an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the Chinese empire.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}} Kang modeled his ideal &quot;Confucian Church&quot; after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchical and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of [[Confucius]].{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}}

In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into different, yet interwoven, directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (''[[shuyuan]]'' 书院),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} the resurgence of [[Confucian rites]] (''chuántǒng lǐyí'' 传统礼仪),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (''shèqū rúxué'' 社区儒学). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of [[lineage churches]] and their [[ancestral temples]], as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the revival of Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. (a). p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of revival are folk religious&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Chinese salvationist religion|salvationist religious]]&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; groups with a specifically Confucian focus, or [[Confucian churches]], for example the ''Yidan xuetang'' (一耽学堂) based in [[Beijing]],&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mengmutang'' (孟母堂) of [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29&quot;&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition]] or phoenix churches,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34&quot;&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 ''Rújiào Dàotán'') in northern Fujian which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34&quot;/&gt; and [[ancestral temples]] of the Kong (Confucius') kin operating as Confucian-teaching churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29&quot;/&gt;

Also, the Hong Kong [[Confucian Academy]] has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and sponsorship of other activities.{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=148}} In 2009 Zhou Beichen founded another institution that inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') in [[Shenzhen]] affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of [[Qufu]] City,{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=152-156}} the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 by the [[Holy Confucian Church]] (孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì''). The first spiritual leader of the Holy Church is the renowned scholar [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]].

Chinese folk religion's temples and kinship ancestral shrines on special occasions may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 ''rú'', or sometimes 正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', meaning &quot;[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]&quot; ritual style) led by Confucian priests (礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods enshrined, instead of Taoist or popular ritual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5&quot;/&gt; &quot;Confucian businessmen&quot; (儒商人 ''rúshāngrén'', also &quot;refined businessman&quot;) is a recently recovered term that defines people of the entrepreneurial or economic elite that recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
[[File:Yushima Seido 002.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Yushima Seidō]] in [[Bunkyō]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it. (''Analects'' 2.1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself according to the universal order. When actual, the king's personal virtue (''de'') spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the [[Great Learning]], and is tightly linked with the [[Taoism|Taoist]] concept of [[wu wei]] ({{zh|t=無為|s=无为|p=wú wéi}}): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the &quot;calm center&quot; around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.

This idea may be traced back to the ancient [[shamanism|shamanic]] beliefs of the [[king]] being the [[axis mundi|axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth]], reflected in the Chinese idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]].

==Meritocracy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (''Analects'' 15.39)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (''Analects'' 7.1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[H. G. Creel]] point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. ''Jūnzǐ'' (君子, lit. &quot;lord's child&quot;), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English &quot;gentleman.&quot;

A virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities can be a &quot;gentleman,&quot; while a shameless son of the king is only a &quot;small man.&quot; That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.

Another new idea, that of [[meritocracy]], led to the introduction of the [[imperial examination]] system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese imperial examination system started in the [[Sui dynasty]]. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations. The practice of meritocracy still exists today in the Chinese cultural sphere, including [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and so forth.

==Influence==
===In 17th-century Europe===
[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;Life and works of Confucius, by [[Prospero Intorcetta]], 1687]]

The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.{{refn|group=note|The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno.}} [[Matteo Ricci]] was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father [[Prospero Intorcetta]] wrote about the life and works of Confucius in [[Latin]] in 1687.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot;&gt;&quot;Windows into China,&quot; John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mungello&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.2307/1397760}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]], John Hobson, pp 194–195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism influenced [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own. It is postulated that certain elements of Leibniz's philosophy, such as &quot;simple substance&quot; and &quot;preestablished harmony,&quot; were borrowed from his interactions with Confucianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mungello&quot;/&gt; The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] was also influenced by Confucius, seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma.&lt;ref name=&quot;epc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ezra Pound and Confucianism: remaking humanism in the face of modernity  |last= Lan|first= Feng|year= 2005|publisher= University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-8020-8941-0|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;epc&quot;/&gt;

===On Islamic thought===
From the late 17th century onwards a whole body of literature known as the [[Han Kitab]] developed amongst the [[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] of China who infused [[Islam]]ic thought with Confucianism. Especially the works of [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] such as ''Tiānfāng Diǎnlǐ''（天方典禮）sought to harmonize Islam with not only Confucianism but also with [[Daoism]] and is considered to be one of the crowning achievements of the Chinese Islamic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=James|title=Uncontrived Concord: The Eclectic Sources and Syncretic Theories of Liu Zhi, a Chinese Muslim Scholar|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2009|volume=20|pages=46–54|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/1/46.abstract|accessdate=12 September 2011|doi=10.1093/jis/etn062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern times===
Important military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord [[Ma Fuxiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+military+academy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_AadTPPfNIP78AaV-OVR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20confucianism%20%20northern&amp;f=false |title= Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |editor1=Stéphane A. Dudoignon |editor2=Hisao Komatsu |editor3=Yasushi Kosugi |year=2006 |publisher= Routledge |location= London |page=250; 375 |isbn=0-415-36835-9 |accessdate= 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Life Movement]] in the early 20th century was also influenced by Confucianism.

Referred to variously as the Confucian hypothesis and as a debated component of the more all-encompassing Asian Development Model, there exists among political scientists and economists a theory that Confucianism plays a large latent role in the ostensibly non-Confucian cultures of modern-day East Asia, in the form of the rigorous work ethic it endowed those cultures with. These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernize and industrialize as quickly as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and even [[China]] has done.

For example, the impact of the [[Vietnam War]] on Vietnam was devastating, however over the last few decades Vietnam has been re-developing in a very fast pace. Most scholars attribute the origins of this idea to futurologist [[Herman Kahn]]'s ''World Economic Development: 1979 and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, George. 1990. &quot;Explaining the Success of the Four Little Dragons: A Survey.&quot; In Seiji Naya and Akira Takayama, eds. ''Economic Development in East and Southeast Asia: Essays in Honor of Professor Shinichi Ichimura.'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies: Singapore, and the East-West Center: Honolulu, p. 25., {{ISBN|9789813035638}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert and Michael Harris Bond. 1988. &quot;The Confucius Connection: From Cultural Roots to Economic Growth.&quot; ''Organizational Dynamics'' 16 (4): p. 6. {{ISSN|0090-2616}}, {{DOI|10.1016/0090-2616(88)90009-5}}, PubMed 4640478, [http://www2.seminolestate.edu/falbritton/Summer%202009/FHI/Articles/Hofstede.confucious%20connection%20120505%20science%20direct.pdf URL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626043702/http://www2.seminolestate.edu/falbritton/Summer%202009/FHI/Articles/Hofstede.confucious%20connection%20120505%20science%20direct.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies, for example Cristobal Kay's ''Why East Asia Overtook Latin America: Agrarian Reform, Industrialization, and Development'', have attributed the Asian growth to other factors, for example the character of agrarian reforms, &quot;state-craft&quot; (state capacity), and interaction between agriculture and industry.&lt;ref&gt;2002. ''Third World Quarterly'' 23 (6): pp. 1073–1102. {{DOI|10.1080/0143659022000036649}}, [http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/~ibagdadi/INT230/Christobal%20Kay%20-%20Why%20East%20Asia%20Overtook%20Latin%20America.pdf URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Chinese martial arts===
After Confucianism had become the official 'state religion' in China, its influence penetrated all walks of life and all streams of thought in Chinese society for the generations to come. This did not exclude martial arts culture. Though in his own day, Confucius had rejected the practice of Martial Arts (with the exception of Archery), he did serve under rulers who used military power extensively to achieve their goals. In later centuries, Confucianism heavily influenced many educated martial artists of great influence, such as [[Sun Lutang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|title=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston - Sun Style Taijiquan &amp; Qigong|author=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston|work=suntaichiboston.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223080456/http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from the 19th century onwards, when empty-handed martial arts in China became more widespread and had begun to more readily absorb philosophical influences from Confucianism, [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]]. Some argue therefore that despite Confucius' disdain with martial culture, his teachings became of much relevance to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il/2014/08/confucianism-and-martial-arts.html|title=Cook Ding's Kitchen: Confucianism and Martial Arts|work=cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Confucius and Confucianism were opposed or criticized from the start, including [[Laozi]]'s philosophy and [[Mozi]]'s critique, and Legalists such as  [[Han Fei]] ridiculed the idea that virtue would lead people to be orderly. In modern times, waves of opposition and vilification showed that Confucianism, instead of taking credit for the glories of Chinese civilization, now had to take blame for its failures. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] described Confucianism sages as well as gods in [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as devils. In the [[New Culture Movement]], [[Lu Xun]] criticised Confucianism for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late [[Qing Dynasty]]: his criticisms are dramatically portrayed in &quot;[[A Madman's Diary]],&quot; which implies that Confucian society was cannibalistic. Leftists during the [[Cultural Revolution]] described Confucius as the representative of the class of slave owners.

In [[South Korea]], there has long been criticism. Some South Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernization of South Korea. For example, South Korean writer Kim Kyong-il wrote an essay {{when?|date=March 2017}} entitled &quot;Confucius Must Die For the Nation to Live&quot; (공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다, ''gongjaga jug-eoya naraga sanda''). Kim said that [[filial piety]] is one-sided and blind, and if it continues social problems will continue as government keeps forcing Confucian filial obligations onto families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=39088 |title=공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다고?&amp;nbsp;– 시사저널 |publisher=Sisapress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=하늘날아|url=http://zerocdh.tistory.com/97|title=지식이 물 흐르듯이 :: 공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다|publisher=Zerocdh.tistory.com|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2012-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415153841/http://zerocdh.tistory.com/97|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Confucian thought===
{{See also|Women in ancient and imperial China}}
Confucianism &quot;largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the [[Han dynasty]] onward.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;  The gender roles prescribed in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] stated that: &quot;To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey&quot;/&gt; Chaste widows were revered and memorialized during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] periods. This &quot;cult of chastity&quot; accordingly condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva? Women in the Teaching of Chinese Religions | work = ASIANetwork Exchange, vol. XIV, no. 2 | date = Winter 2006 | url = http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Women.htm | accessdate = 18 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western scholars until the mid-1990s accepted the view of Confucianism as a sexist, patriarchal ideology. It has also been argued by some Chinese and Western writers that the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty had led to a decline of status of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=15–16 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have also accused the prominent Song neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] for believing in the inferiority of women and that men and women need to be kept strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, scholars have also discussed the attitudes toward women in Confuican texts such as [[Analects]], where it has suggested that women may be comparable to ''xiaoren'' (小人, literally &quot;small people&quot;, meaning people of low status or low moral) who are difficult to cultivate or interact with.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Chong 邱崇, &quot;释 '唯女子与小人为难养也'&quot; ''Yuejiang Academic Journal,'' vol.6 (December:2013),141-145. http://qk.nuist.edu.cn/yj/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20130621&amp;year_id=2013&amp;quarter_id=6&amp;falg=1 The article points out the various disputes among traditional Confucian commentators on what the passage really means. It also summarizes the debate in contemporary academia regarding the phrase's meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further analysis suggests, however, that women's place in Confucian society may be more complex.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt; During the Han dynasty period, the influential Confucian text [[Lessons for Women]] (Nüjie), was written by [[Ban Zhao]] (45–114 CE) to instruct her daughters how to be proper Confucian wives and mothers, that is, to be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the male. However, she does present education and literary power as important for women. In later dynasties, a number of women took advantage of the Confucian acknowledgment of education to become independent in thought.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;

Indeed, as Joseph A. Adler points out, &quot;Neo-Confucian writings do not necessarily reflect either the prevailing social practices or the scholars' own attitudes and practices in regard to actual women.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt; Matthew Sommers has also indicated that the Qing dynasty government began to realize the utopian nature of enforcing the &quot;cult of chastity&quot; and began to allow practices such as widow remarrying to stand.&lt;ref&gt; Matthew Sommers, Sex, Law and Society in Late Imperial China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some Confucian texts like the ''Chunqiu Fanlu'' 春秋繁露 have passages that suggest a more equal relationship between a husband and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/chun-qiu-fan-lu/ji-yi/zh|title=春秋繁露 : 基義 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, some scholars have also begun to discuss the viability of constructing a &quot;Confucian feminism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=4 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic controversy over Chinese rites==
{{main article|Chinese Rites controversy}}
Ever since Europeans first encountered Confucianism, the issue of how Confucianism should be classified has been subject to debate. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian [[Jesuits]], considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elman&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Elman|2005|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits, including [[Matteo Ricci]], saw Chinese rituals as &quot;civil rituals&quot; that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elman&quot;/&gt;

By the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]], creating a dispute among Catholics in [[East Asia]] that was known as the &quot;Rites Controversy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunn|2003|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that [[Chinese ancestral worship]] was a form of idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn&quot;/&gt;

Confucianism is definitively [[pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[nontheism|nontheistic]], in that it is not based on the belief in the supernatural or in a personal god existing separate to the temporal plane.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Yang|1961|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students: &quot;You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinaiko&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sinaiko|1998|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes such as [[ancestor worship]], [[ritual]], and [[sacrifice]] were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; these attributes can be traced to the traditional [[Chinese folk religion]].

Scholars recognize that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion. Using stricter definitions of religion, Confucianism has been described as a moral science or philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm Centre for Confucian Science (Korea)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716073420/http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urantiabook.org/archive/readers/601_confucianism.htm|title=Introduction to Confucianism|work=urantiabook.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; But using a broader definition, such as Frederick Streng's characterization of religion as &quot;a means of ultimate transformation,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Streng, Frederick, &quot;Understanding Religious Life,&quot; 3rd ed. (1985), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism could be described as a &quot;sociopolitical doctrine having religious qualities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;/&gt; With the latter definition, Confucianism is religious, even if non-theistic, in the sense that it &quot;performs some of the basic psycho-social functions of full-fledged religions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;/&gt;
