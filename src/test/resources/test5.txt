'''Debian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|i|ə|n}})&lt;ref name=&quot;debfaq-def&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;debianorg-about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Debian -- About |url = https://www.debian.org/intro/about |website = Debian |publisher = Debian |access-date = 12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] that is composed entirely of [[free software]] and packaged by a group of individuals participating in the Debian Project.

The Debian Project was first announced in 1993 by [[Ian Murdock]], Debian 0.01 was released on September 15, 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;ChangeLog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/debian-0.91/ChangeLog |title = ChangeLog |publisher = [[ibiblio]] |access-date = 2016-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first ''stable'' release was made in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Chapter 3 – Debian Releases |url = https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-releases.en.html |website = A Brief History of Debian |publisher = Debian Documentation Team |access-date = 10 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debian ''stable'' [[Debian#Branches|release branch]] is the most popular Debian edition for [[personal computer]]s and [[Server (computing)|network servers]], and has been used as a base for many other distributions.

The project's work is carried out over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the [[List of Debian project leaders|Debian Project Leader]] and three foundational documents: the [[Debian Social Contract]], the Debian Constitution, and the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based [[Freeze (software engineering)|freeze]].

As one of the earliest [[Linux distribution|operating systems based on the Linux kernel]], it was decided that Debian was to be developed openly and freely distributed in the spirit of the [[GNU Project]]. This decision drew the attention and support of the [[Free Software Foundation]], which sponsored the project for one year from November 1994 to November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-detailed.en.html |title = A Brief History of Debian – A Detailed History |access-date = October 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the ending of the sponsorship, the Debian Project formed the non-profit organisation [[Software in the Public Interest]].

While all Debian releases are derived from the [[GNU|GNU Operating System]] and use the GNU userland and the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc), other kernels aside from the [[Linux kernel]] are also available, such as those based on BSD kernels and the [[GNU Hurd]] microkernel.

== Kernels ==

Debian supports [[Linux kernel|Linux]] officially, offered [[Debian GNU/kFreeBSD|kFreeBSD]] for version 7 but not 8,&lt;ref name=&quot;new-in-7&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/i386/release-notes/ch-whats-new.html |work = Release Notes for Debian 7.0 (wheezy), 32-bit PC |title = Chapter 2. What's new in Debian 7.0 |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GNU Hurd]] unofficially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/ports/hurd/ |title = Debian GNU/Hurd |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-05-01 |access-date = 2014-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GNU/kFreeBSD was released as a technology preview for [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] [[computer architecture|architectures]],&lt;ref name=&quot;new-in-7&quot; /&gt; and lacked the amount of software available in Debian's Linux distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://release.debian.org/wheezy/arch_qualify.html |title = architecture requalification status for wheezy |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official support for kFreeBSD was removed for version 8, which did not provide a kFreeBSD-based distribution.

Several flavors of the Linux kernel exist for each port. For example, the i386 port has flavors for IA-32 [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] supporting [[Physical Address Extension]] and [[real-time computing]], for older PCs, and for x86-64 PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/linux-image |title = Virtual Package: linux-image |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linux kernel does not officially contain [[firmware]] without sources, although such firmware is available in non-free packages and alternative installation media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-source.html |work = Debian Linux Kernel Handbook |title = Chapter 2 – Debian kernel source |publisher = [[Alioth (Debian)|Alioth]] |date = 2013-12-14 |access-date = 2014-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/ |title = Unofficial non-free CDs including firmware packages |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Installation and live images ==
Debian offers DVD and CD [[ISO image|images]] for installation that can be downloaded using [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] or [[jigdo]]. Physical disks can also be bought from retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/CD/ |title = Debian on CDs |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-05-10 |access-date = 2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full sets are made up of several discs (the amd64 port consists of 13 DVDs or 84 CDs),&lt;ref name=&quot;jigdo-cd&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/#which |title = Downloading Debian CD images with jigdo |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-05-10 |access-date = 2014-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but only the first disc is required for installation, as the installer can retrieve software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#stable |title = Downloading Debian CD/DVD images via HTTP/FTP |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-05-17 |access-date = 2014-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debian offers different network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian is available via the ''[[netinst]]'' CD, whereby Debian is installed with just a base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. Another option is to boot the installer from the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/distrib/netinst |title = Installing Debian GNU/Linux via the Internet |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Installation images are [[Hybrid disc|hybrid]] on some architectures and can be used to create a [[booting|bootable]] USB drive ([[Live USB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/amd64/ch04s03.html#usb-copy-isohybrid |work = Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide |title = 4.3. Preparing Files for USB Memory Stick Booting |publisher = Debian |year = 2010 |access-date = 2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default bootstrap loader is [[GNU GRUB]] version 2, though the package name is simply grub, while version 1 was renamed to grub-legacy. This conflicts with e.g. [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], where grub version 2 is named grub2.

The default desktop may be chosen from the DVD boot menu among [[GNOME]], [[KDE Software Compilation]], [[Xfce]] and [[LXDE]], and from special disc 1 CDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;installation-7-6.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/i386/ch06s03.html.en |work = Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide |title = 6.3.

== History ==
=== Founding (1993–98) ===
Debian was first announced on August 16, 1993, by [[Ian Murdock]], who initially called the system &quot;the Debian Linux Release&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-intro.en.html |work = A Brief History of Debian |title = Chapter 1 – Introduction – What is the Debian Project? |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-05-04 |access-date = 2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title = New release under development; suggestions requested |url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.development/Md3Modzg5TU/xty88y5OLaMJ |message-id = CBusDD.MIK@unix.portal.com |last = Murdock |first = Ian A. |authorlink = Ian Murdock |date = 1993-08-16 |newsgroup = comp.os.linux.development |access-date = 2012-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;Debian&quot; was formed as a [[portmanteau]] of the first name of his then-girlfriend Debra Lynn and his own first name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Nixon |first = Robin |title = Ubuntu: Up and Running |page = 3 |publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] |year = 2010 |isbn = 978-0-596-80484-8 |url = //books.google.com/books?id=badSTnfeOoAC |access-date = 2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Debian's release, the [[Softlanding Linux System]] (SLS) had been a popular Linux distribution and the basis for [[Slackware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grassroots&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Debian and the grass roots of Linux |url = http://www.itpro.co.uk/135084/debian-and-the-grass-roots-of-linux |last = Hillesley |first = Richard |publisher = IT Pro |date = 2007-11-02 |access-date = 2014-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived poor maintenance and prevalence of [[software bug|bugs]] in SLS motivated Murdock to launch a new distribution.{{sfn |Scheetz |1998 |p=17}}

Debian 0.01, released on September 15, 1993, was the first of several internal releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChangeLog&quot; /&gt; Version 0.90 was the first public release,&lt;ref name=&quot;ChangeLog&quot; /&gt; providing support through mailing lists hosted at Pixar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/debian-0.91/debian-0.91/RELEASE-0.91 |title = Release-0.91 |publisher = [[ibiblio]] |date = 1994-01-31 |access-date = 2014-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release included the Debian Linux Manifesto, outlining Murdock's view for the new [[operating system]]. In it he called for the creation of a distribution to be maintained openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/debian-0.91/info/Manifesto |title = The Debian Linux Manifesto |last = Murdock |first = Ian A. |authorlink = Ian Murdock |publisher = [[ibiblio]] |date = 1994-01-06 |access-date = 2014-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debian project released the 0.9x versions in 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;releases&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-releases.en.html |work = A Brief History of Debian |title = Chapter 3 – Debian Releases |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-05-04 |access-date = 2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time it was sponsored by the [[Free Software Foundation]] for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.misc/A30TG4KRx4Y/WKi_Yx0iuTAJ |title = The FSF is no longer sponsoring Debian |message-id = gnusenet199604280427.AAA00388@delasyd.gnu.ai.mit.edu |last = Stallman |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard Stallman |newsgroup = comp.os.linux.misc |date = 1996-04-28 |access-date = 2014-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Murdock delegated the base system, the core packages of Debian, to Bruce Perens and Murdock focused on the management of the growing project.{{sfn |Scheetz |1998 |p=18}} The first ports to non-[[IA-32]] architectures began in 1995, and Debian 1.1 was released in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-detailed.en.html |work = A Brief History of Debian |title = Chapter 4 – A Detailed History |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-05-04 |access-date = 2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time and thanks to [[Ian Jackson]], the dpkg package manager was already an essential part of Debian.{{sfn |Krafft |2005 |pp=31–32}}

In 1996, Bruce Perens assumed the project leadership. Perens was a controversial leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian.{{sfn |Hertzog |2013 |p=9}} He drafted a [[social contract]] and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/1997/msg00017.html |title = Debian's 'Social Contract' with the Free Software Community |last = Perens |first = Bruce |authorlink = Bruce Perens |mailinglist = debian-announce |publisher = Debian |date = 1997-07-05 |access-date = 2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship in the midst of the [[Free and open-source software|free software vs. open source debate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/02/msg01641.html |title = It's Time to Talk About Free Software Again |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140716055445/https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/02/msg01641.html |archivedate = July 16, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perens initiated the creation of the legal [[umbrella organization]] [[Software in the Public Interest]] instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot; /&gt; He led the conversion of the project from [[a.out]] to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]].{{sfn |Scheetz |1998 |p=19}} He created the [[BusyBox]] program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4335 |title = Building Tiny Linux Systems with Busybox–Part I |last = Perens |first = Bruce |authorlink = Bruce Perens |publisher = [[Linux Journal]] |date = 2000-11-01 |access-date = 2014-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers.{{sfn |Scheetz |1998 |p=19}} Perens left the project in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/1998/03/msg01628.html |title = I am leaving Debian |last = Perens |first = Bruce |authorlink = Bruce Perens |publisher = Debian |mailinglist = debian-user |date = 1998-03-18 |access-date = 2014-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarge and later releases (2005–15) ===
[[File:Debian Etch-ja.png|thumb|250px|Debian 4.0 Etch (2007)]]
The 3.1 Sarge release was made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the software and included over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a modular design, [[Debian-Installer]], allowed installations with [[RAID]], [[XFS]] and [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of [[Skolelinux]], [[Debian-Med]] and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=sargenew&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/sarge/i386/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html |work = Release Notes for Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (`sarge'), Intel x86 |title = Chapter 2 – What's new in Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 |publisher = Debian |date = 2006-09-18 |access-date = 2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iceweasel icon.svg|thumb|64px|left|[[Iceweasel]] logo]]
In 2006, as a result of a much-publicized dispute, [[Mozilla software rebranded by Debian|Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian]], with [[Firefox]] forked as Iceweasel and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]  as Icedove. The Mozilla Corporation stated that software with unapproved modifications could not be distributed under the Firefox trademark. Two reasons that Debian modifies the Firefox software are to change the non-free artwork and to provide security patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive09.linux.com/feature/57675 |publisher = [[Linux.com]] |title = Behind the Debian and Mozilla dispute over use of Firefox |date = 2006-10-10 |first = Lisa |last = Hoover |access-date = 2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/10/msg00665.html |title = Re: Will IceWeasel be based on a fork or on vanilla FireFox? |last = Sanchez |first = Roberto C. |mailinglist = debian-devel |publisher = Debian |date = 2006-10-15 |access-date = 2014-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, it was announced that Mozilla and Debian had reached agreement and Iceweasel would revert to the name Firefox; similar agreement was anticipated for Icedove/Thunderbird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/3036509/linux/iceweasel-will-be-renamed-firefox-as-relations-between-debian-and-mozilla-thaw.html |title = 'Iceweasel' will be renamed 'Firefox' as relations between Debian and Mozilla thaw |last = Hoffman |first = Chris |publisher = PC World |date = 2016-02-24 |access-date = 2016-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Debian 6.0.2.1.png|thumb|250px|Debian 6.0 Squeeze (2011)]]

In July 2009, the policy of time-based development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended to blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time.&lt;ref name=&quot;two-year-cycle&quot; /&gt; The Squeeze cycle was going to be especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;two-year-cycle-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/News/2009/20090730 |title = Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 'Squeeze' release goals |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2009-12-01 |date = 2009-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the [[backporting|backports]] service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.&lt;ref name=&quot;news-backports-official&quot; /&gt;

== Releases ==
{{Main|Debian version history}}

=== Release cycle ===
Stable version of Debian gets released approximately every 2 years. It will receive official support for about 3 years with update for major security or usability fixes. Point releases will be available every several months as determined by Stable Release Managers (SRM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Point Releases - Debian Wiki|url=https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases|access-date=2017-09-27|publisher=Debian Release Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debian also launched its Long Term Support (LTS) project since Debian 6 (Debian Squeeze). For each Debian release, it will receive two years of extra security updates provided by LTS Team after its End Of Life (EOL). However, no point releases will be made. Now each Debian release can receive 5 years of security support in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LTS - Debian Wiki|url=https://wiki.debian.org/LTS|work=Debian LTS Team|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Desktop environments ==

Debian offers CD images specifically built for GNOME (the default desktop), KDE Software Compilation, Xfce and LXDE.&lt;ref name=&quot;squeeze released&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Debian 6.0 'Squeeze' released |publisher = Debian |url = //www.debian.org/News/2011/20110205a |date = 2011-02-06 |access-date = 2011-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MATE (desktop environment)|MATE]] is officially supported,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/wheezy-backports/mate-desktop |title = Package: mate-desktop (1.8.1+dfsg1-1~bpo70+1) |access-date = 2014-07-06 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cinnamon (software)|Cinnamon]] support was added with Debian 8.0 Jessie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Debian – Details of package cinnamon in jessie |url = https://packages.debian.org/en/jessie/cinnamon |website = packages.debian.org |access-date = 2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less common [[window manager]]s such as [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], [[Openbox]], [[Fluxbox]], [[IceWM]], [[Window Maker]] and others are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/sid/x-window-manager |title = Virtual Package: x-window-manager |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default desktop environment of version 7.0 Wheezy was temporarily switched to Xfce, because GNOME 3 did not fit on the first CD of the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTE1NTk |last = Larabel |first = Michael |authorlink = Michael Larabel |title = Debian Now Defaults To Xfce Desktop |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2012-08-08 |access-date = 2012-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The default for the version 8.0 Jessie was changed again to Xfce in November 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://linux.softpedia.com/blog/Debian-8-0-quot-Jessie-quot-Ditches-GNOME-and-Adopts-Xfce-397262.shtml |title = Debian 8.0 'Jessie' Ditches GNOME and Adopts Xfce |last = Stahie |first = Silviu |publisher = [[Softpedia]] |date = 2013-11-05 |access-date = 2014-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and back to GNOME in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/tasksel/tasksel.git/commit/?id=dce99f5f8d84e4c885e6beb4cc1bb5bb1d9ee6d7 |title = switch default desktop to GNOME |last = Hess |first = Joey |publisher = [[Alioth (Debian)|Alioth]] |date = 2014-09-19 |access-date = 2014-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debian Live ==

Debian releases [[live CD|live install]] images for CDs, DVDs and USB thumb drives, for [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] architectures, and with a choice of desktop environments. These ''Debian Live'' images allow users to boot from removable media and run Debian without affecting the contents of their computer.

A full install of Debian to the computer's hard drive can be initiated from the live image environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/CD/live/ |title = Live install images |date = 2013-10-27 |access-date = 2013-12-07 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personalized images can be built with the live-build tool for discs, USB drives and for [[network booting]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://live.debian.net/manual/stable/html/live-manual.en.html |title = Debian Live Manual |publisher = Debian |year = 2013 |access-date = 2014-07-06 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214191646/http://live.debian.net/manual/stable/html/live-manual.en.html |archivedate = February 14, 2014 |df = mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Package management ==

[[Package management system|Package management]] operations can be performed with different tools available on Debian, from the lowest level command &lt;kbd&gt;dpkg&lt;/kbd&gt; to graphical front-ends like Synaptic. The recommended standard for administering packages on a Debian system is the &lt;kbd&gt;apt&lt;/kbd&gt; toolset.&lt;ref name=&quot;deb-ref-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html |work = Debian Reference |title = Chapter 2. Debian package management |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-12-03 |access-date = 2014-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[dpkg]] provides the low-level infrastructure for package management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/dpkg |title = Package: dpkg (1.16.15) &amp;#91;security&amp;#93; &amp;#91;essential&amp;#93; |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dpkg database contains the list of installed software on the current system. The dpkg command tool does not know about repositories. The command can work with local [[deb (file format)|.deb]] package files, and information from the dpkg database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dpkg |title = dpkg |publisher = Debian |date = 2012-06-05 |access-date = 2014-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== APT tools ===

[[File:Debian 7 Aptitude Package Details.png|thumb|Using [[Aptitude]] to view Debian package details]] [[File:Debian-aptitude.png|thumb|Package installed with Aptitude]]
An [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (APT) tool allows administering an installed Debian system to retrieve and resolve package [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] from [[Software repository|repositories]]. APT tools share dependency information and cached packages.&lt;ref name=&quot;deb-ref-2&quot; /&gt;
* [[Aptitude (software)|Aptitude]] is a [[command line]] tool that also offers a [[text-based user interface]]. The program comes with enhancements such as better search on package [[metadata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deb-ref-2&quot; /&gt;
* &lt;kbd&gt;apt-get&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;apt-cache&lt;/kbd&gt; are command tools of the standard [[Advanced Packaging Tool#Usage|apt]] package. apt-get installs and removes packages, and apt-cache is used for searching packages and displaying package information.&lt;ref name=&quot;deb-ref-2&quot; /&gt;

=== {{Anchor|GDEBI}}GDebi and other front-ends ===

[[GDebi]] is an APT tool which can be used in command-line and on the GUI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://launchpad.net/gdebi/ |title = gdebi |publisher = [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GDebi can install a local .deb file via the command line like the dpkg command, but with access to repositories to resolve dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/163019/ubuntu_tricks.html |title = 10 Expert Ubuntu Tricks |last = Thomas |first = Keir |authorlink = Keir Thomas |publisher = [[PC World]] |date = 2009-04-13 |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other graphical front-ends for APT include [[Ubuntu Software Center|Software Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/software-center |title = Package: software-center (5.1.2debian3.1) |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/synaptic |title = Package: synaptic (0.75.13) |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/apper |title = Package: apper (0.7.2-5) |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GNOME Software]] is a graphical front-end for [[PackageKit]], which itself can work on top of various software packaging systems.

== Branches ==
[[File:Debian-cd-cover1.png|thumb|A Debian 4.0 Etch box cover]]

Three [[Branching (revision control)|branches]] of Debian (also called ''releases'', ''distributions'' or ''suites'') are regularly maintained:&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-releases&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Debian Releases |url = //www.debian.org/releases/ |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Stable'' is the current release and targets stable and well-tested software needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.zdnet.com/the-new-debian-linux-7-0-is-now-available-7000014911/ |title = The new Debian Linux 7.0 is now available |last = Vaughan-Nichols |first = Steven J. |publisher = [[ZDNet]] |date = 2013-05-05 |access-date = 2014-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stable'' is made by freezing ''Testing'' for a few months where bugs are fixed and packages with too many bugs are removed; then the resulting system is released as ''stable''. It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; This branch has an optional [[Backporting|backports]] service that provides more recent versions of some software.&lt;ref name=&quot;news-backports-official&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/News/2010/20100905 |title = Backports service becoming official |publisher = Debian |date = 2010-09-05 |access-date = 2014-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stable''{{'}}s CDs and DVDs can be found in the Debian website.&lt;ref name=&quot;jigdo-cd&quot; /&gt;
* ''Testing'' is the preview branch that will eventually become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in ''unstable'' but they may not be fit for release yet. It contains newer packages than ''stable'' but older than ''unstable''. This branch is updated continually until it is frozen.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; ''Testing''{{'}}s CDs and DVDs can be found on the Debian website.&lt;ref name=&quot;jigdo-cd&quot; /&gt;
* ''Unstable'', always codenamed ''sid'', is the [[Trunk (software)|trunk]]. Packages are accepted without checking the distribution as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; This branch is usually run by software developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those who prefer [[Bleeding edge technology|bleeding-edge]] software.&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-releases&quot; /&gt; Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs, but rather a minimal ISO that can be used to install over a network connection. Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from ''stable'' or ''testing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/CD/faq/#unstable-images |title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other branches in Debian:
* ''Oldstable'' is the prior ''stable'' release.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; It is supported by the Debian Security Team until one year after a new ''stable'' is released, and since the release of Debian 6, for another 2 years through the Long Term Support project.&lt;ref name=&quot;securityfaq&quot; /&gt; Eventually, ''oldstable'' is moved to a repository for archived releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt;
* ''Oldoldstable'' is the prior ''oldstable'' release. It is supported by the Long Term Support community. Eventually, ''oldoldstable'' is moved to a repository for archived releases.
* ''Experimental'' is a temporary staging area of highly experimental software that is likely to break the system. It is not a full distribution and missing dependencies are commonly found in ''unstable'', where new software without the damage chance is normally uploaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt;

The ''snapshot'' archive provides older versions of the branches. They may be used to install a specific older version of some software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://snapshot.debian.org/ |title = snapshot.debian.org |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbering scheme ===
''Stable'' and ''oldstable'' get minor updates, called ''point releases''; {{as of|2017|06|lc=y}}, the ''stable'' release is version 9.3,&lt;ref name=&quot;stretch-changelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/ChangeLog |title = ChangeLog |work = stretch |publisher = Debian |date = 2017-06-17 |access-date = 2017-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''oldstable'' release is version 8.10.&lt;ref name=&quot;jessie-changelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/ChangeLog |title = ChangeLog |work = jessie |publisher = Debian |date = 2017-05-06 |access-date = 2017-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbering scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was to include the letter ''r'' (for ''revision'')&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzog-1.6&quot; /&gt; after the main version number and then the number of the point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9.&lt;ref name=&quot;etch-release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian-4.0/Release |title = Release |work = etch |publisher = Debian |date = 2010-05-22 |access-date = 2014-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1998/08/msg01581.html |title = Naming of new 2.0 release |last = Schulze |first = Martin |mailinglist = debian-devel |publisher = Debian |date = 1998-08-24 |access-date = 2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Debian 5.0, the numbering scheme of point releases was changed, conforming to the GNU version numbering standard;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Releases.html#index-version-numbers_002c-for-releases |title = GNU Coding Standards: Releases |publisher = [[GNU]] |date = 2014-05-13 |access-date = 2014-05-25 |quote = You should identify each release with a pair of version numbers, a major version and a minor. We have no objection to using more than two numbers, but it is very unlikely that you really need them. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first point release of Debian 5.0 was 5.0.1 instead of 5.0r1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/02/msg00003.html |first = Marc |last = Brockschmidt |access-date = 2009-02-15 |date = 2009-02-15 |mailinglist = debian-devel-announce |title = Debian squeeze waiting for development |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbering scheme was once again changed for the first Debian 7 update, which was version 7.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;wheezy-changelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/ChangeLog |title = ChangeLog |work = wheezy |publisher = Debian |date = 2016-06-04 |access-date = 2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''r'' scheme is no longer in use, but point release announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/News/2014/20141018 |title = Updated Debian 7: 7.7 released |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-10-18 |access-date = 2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code names ===
The code names of Debian releases are [[list of Toy Story characters|names of characters]] from the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films.  Debian 9 was named Stretch after the [[Stretch (Toy Story)|toy rubber octopus]] in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. Debian 8 was named Jessie, after the [[Jessie (Toy Story)|cowgirl]] in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and ''Toy Story 3''.  The ''Testing'' branch is currently named Buster, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/11/msg00005.html |title = Release Team Sprint Results |date = 2014-11-09 |publisher = Debian |last = Wiltshire |first = Jonathan |website = lists.debian.org |access-date = 2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the real (not the toy) dog seen in ''Toy Story 2'' and ''3''. Debian 11 will be called &quot;Bullseye&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/07/msg00002.html |website = lists.debian.org |title = Bits from the release team: Winter is Coming (but not to South Africa) |publisher = Debian |last = Wiltshire |first = Jonathan |access-date = 2017-04-07 |date = 2016-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, Woody's toy horse.  The ''unstable'' trunk is permanently nicknamed [[Sid (Toy Story)|Sid]], after the emotionally unstable [[boy next door]] who regularly destroyed toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-ftparchives |work = The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ |title = Chapter 6 – The Debian FTP archives |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-06-02 |access-date = 2013-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This naming tradition came about because [[Bruce Perens]] was involved in the early development of Debian while working at [[Pixar]].{{sfn |Hertzog |2013 |p=9}}

=== Blends ===
[[Debian Pure Blend]]s are subsets of a Debian release configured out-of-the-box for users with particular skills and interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-pure-blends&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blends.debian.org/blends/ch02.html#Blends |work = Debian Pure Blends |title = Chapter 2. What are Debian Pure Blends? |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Debian Jr. is made for children, while [[Debian Science]] is for researchers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/ |title = Debian Jr. Project |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-04-30 |access-date = 2014-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete Debian distribution includes all available Debian Pure Blends.&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-pure-blends&quot; /&gt; &quot;Debian Blend&quot; (without &quot;Pure&quot;) is a term for a Debian-based distribution that strives to become part of mainstream Debian, and have its extra features included in future releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-blends/2011/07/msg00010.html |title = Re: Difference between blends and remastered systems |last = Armstrong |first = Ben |publisher = Debian |mailinglist = debian-blends |date = 2011-07-06 |access-date = 2014-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logo ==

[[File:Debian-OpenLogo.svg|thumb| The &quot;swirl&quot; logo represents the [[magic smoke]].]]


The Debian &quot;swirl&quot; logo was designed by Raul Silva&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gnuart.onshore.com/ |title = GNU/art }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2010/10/msg00119.html |title = Logo credit }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 as part of a contest to replace the semi-official logo that had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/News/1999/19990204.en.html |title = Debian Logo Contest }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the contest received an @debian.org [[email address]], and a set of Debian 2.1 install CDs for the architecture of their choice. There has been no official statement from the Debian project on the logo's meaning, but at the time of the logo's selection, it was suggested that the logo represented the [[magic smoke]] ( [https://www.debian.org/logos/officiallogo-100.jpg or the genie] ) that made computers work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/1999/06/msg00001.html |title = [PROPOSED] Swap the &quot;open&quot; and &quot;official&quot; versions of the new logo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.linux.slashdot.org/story/99/06/04/0412213/debian-chooses-logo |title = Debian Chooses Logo |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150218181919/http://www.linux.slashdot.org/story/99/06/04/0412213/debian-chooses-logo |archivedate = February 18, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01782.html |title = Origins of the Debian logo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory about the origin of the Debian logo is that [[Buzz Lightyear]], the chosen character for the first named Debian release, has a swirl in his chin.{{sfn |Krafft |2005 |p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.pixar.com/sites/default/files/ts_billboards_title_v3.jpg |title=Toy Story |type=Billboard |publisher=[[Pixar]] |access-date=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefano Zacchiroli]] also suggested that this swirl is the Debian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://upsilon.cc/~zack/talks/2010/20101204-versailles.pdf |title = Debian: 17 ans de logiciel libre, 'do-ocracy' et démocratie |page = 6 |publisher = [[Stefano Zacchiroli]] |date = 2010-12-04 |access-date = 2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archive areas ==
The [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] (DFSG) define the distinctive meaning of the word &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;[[free and open-source software]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialcontract&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/social_contract |title = Debian Social Contract |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packages which comply with these guidelines, usually under the GNU General Public License, [[BSD licenses|Modified BSD License]] or [[Artistic License]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/legal/licenses/ |title = License information |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are included inside the ''main'' area;&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/resources.html |work = Debian Developer's Reference |title = Chapter 4. Resources for Debian Developers |access-date = 2008-10-31 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise, they are included inside the ''non-free'' and ''contrib'' areas. These last two areas are not distributed within the official installation media, but they can be adopted manually.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialcontract&quot; /&gt;

Non-free includes packages which do not comply with the DFSG,&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-policy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-sections |work = Debian Policy Manual |title = Chapter 2 – The Debian Archive |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-10-28 |access-date = 2014-07-09 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140713200533/http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-sections |archivedate = July 13, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as documentation with invariant sections and [[proprietary software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001#amendmenttexta |title = General Resolution: Why the GNU Free Documentation License is not suitable for Debian main |publisher = Debian |year = 2006 |access-date = 2014-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/fglrx-driver |title = Package: fglrx-driver (1:12-6+point-3) &amp;#91;non-free&amp;#93; |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and legally questionable packages.&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-policy&quot; /&gt; Contrib includes packages which do comply with the DFSG but fail other requirements. For example, they may depend on packages which are in non-free or requires such for building them.&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-policy&quot; /&gt;

[[Richard Stallman]] and the [[Free Software Foundation]] have criticized the Debian project for hosting the non-free repository and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/common-distros.html |title = Explaining Why We Don't Endorse Other Systems |access-date = 2014-06-19 |publisher = [[GNU]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/gnuherds-app-dev/2007-10/msg00049.html |title = Re: Debian vs gNewSense – FS criteria |last = Stallman |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard Stallman |mailinglist = gnuherds-app-dev |publisher = lists.nongnu.org |date = 2007-10-06 |access-date = 2014-07-09 |quote = What makes Debian unacceptable is that its inclusion of non-free software is not a mistake. }}&lt;/ref&gt; an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/1999/06/msg00043.html |mailinglist = debian-vote |title = Moving contrib and non-free of master.debian.org |last = Akkerman |first = Wichert |date = 1999-06-21 |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2014/03/msg00224.html |title = non-free? |last = Wise |first = Paul |mailinglist = debian-vote |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-03-22 |access-date = 2014-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the last time it came to a vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.&lt;ref name=&quot;nonfreeremovalvote&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_002 |title = General Resolution: Status of the non-free section |year = 2004 |access-date = 2009-09-28 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multimedia support ==
Multimedia support has been problematic in Debian regarding [[codec]]s threatened by possible patent infringements, without sources or under too restrictive licenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://wiki.debian.org/MultimediaCodecs?action=diff&amp;rev1=56&amp;rev2=59 |title = Diff for 'MultimediaCodecs' |last = Mejia |first = Andres |publisher = Debian Wiki |date = 2012-03-18 |access-date = 2014-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regarding technologies such as [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lenny released&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/News/2009/20090214.en.html |title = Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 released |access-date = 2009-02-15 |publisher = Debian |date = 2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though packages with problems related to their distribution could go into the non-free area, software such as [[libdvdcss]] is not hosted at Debian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=154281 |title = RFP: libdvdcss – Library to read scrambled DVDs |publisher = Debian BTS |date = 2002-07-25 |access-date = 2014-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable third party repository exists, formerly named debian-multimedia.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2009/02/16/debian_lenny_review/ |title = 'Lenny': Debian for the masses? |last = Gilbertson |first = Scott |publisher = [[The Register]] |date = 2009-02-16 |access-date = 2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.linux-mag.com/id/5006/ |title = Cool APT Repositories for Ubuntu and Debian |last = Granneman |first = Scott |authorlink = Scott Granneman |publisher = [[Linux Magazine]] |date = 2008-02-06 |access-date = 2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://linux.softpedia.com/blog/Window-Maker-Live-CD-2012-03-18-Available-for-Download-259448.shtml |title = Window Maker Live CD 2012-03-18 Available for Download |last = Nestor |first = Marius |publisher = [[Softpedia]] |date = 2012-03-19 |access-date = 2014-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing software not present in Debian such as [[Windows API|Windows]] codecs, libdvdcss and the [[Adobe Flash Player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://deb-multimedia.org/pool/main/ |title = Packages |publisher = deb-multimedia.org |access-date = 2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this repository is maintained by Christian Marillat, a Debian developer, it is not part of the project and is not hosted on a Debian server. The repository provides packages already included in Debian, interfering with the official maintenance. Eventually, project leader Stefano Zacchiroli asked Marillat to either settle an agreement about the packaging or to stop using the &quot;Debian&quot; name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-multimedia-maintainers/2012-May/026678.html |title = on package duplication between Debian and debian-multimedia |last = Zacchiroli |first = Stefano |authorlink = Stefano Zacchiroli |mailinglist = pkg-multimedia-maintainers |publisher = [[Alioth (Debian)|Alioth]] |date = 2012-05-05 |access-date = 2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marillat chose the latter and renamed the repository to deb-multimedia.org. The repository was so popular that the switchover was announced by the official blog of the Debian project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://bits.debian.org/2013/06/remove-debian-multimedia.html |title = Remove unofficial debian-multimedia.org repository from your sources |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-06-14 |access-date = 2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware support ==

=== Hardware requirements ===
Hardware requirements are at least those of the kernel and the [[GNU]] toolsets.&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch02s01.html.en |work = Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide |title = 2.1. Supported Hardware |publisher = Debian |year = 2015 |access-date = 2017-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debian's recommended system requirements depend on the level of installation, which corresponds to increased numbers of installed components:&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch03s04.html.en |work = Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide |title = 3.4.

The real minimum memory requirements depend on the architecture and may be much less than the numbers listed in this table. It is possible to install Debian with 60&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] of RAM for x86-64;&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs1&quot; /&gt; the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a [[Paging|swap partition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;installation-7-6.3&quot; /&gt; The installer for [[z/Architecture]] requires about 20&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM, but relies on network hardware.&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/releases/jessie/s390x/ch05s01.html.en |work = Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide |title = 5.1. Booting the Installer on S/390 |publisher = Debian |year = 2015 |access-date = 2017-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, disk space requirements, which depend on the packages to be installed, can be reduced by manually selecting the packages needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs1&quot; /&gt; {{As of|2014|8}}, no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blends.debian.org/blends/ch04.html |work = Debian Pure Blends |title = Chapter 4. Existing Debian Pure Blends |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-06-19 |access-date = 2014-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to run [[graphical user interface]]s on older or low-end systems, but the installation of [[window manager]]s instead of [[desktop environment]]s is recommended, as desktop environments are more resource-intensive. Requirements for individual software vary widely and must be considered, with those of the base operating environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;hreqs1&quot; /&gt;

== Support for communities ==

=== Localization ===
Several parts of Debian are translated into languages other than American English, including package descriptions, configuration messages, documentation and the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/international/l10n/ |title = Central Debian translation statistics |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of software localization depends on the language, ranging from the highly supported [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] to the hardly translated [[Muscogee language|Creek]] and [[Samoan language|Samoan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/international/l10n/po/rank |title = Status of the l10n in Debian — ranking PO files between languages |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installer is available in 73 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00000.html |title = Debian Installer 7.0 RC3 release |access-date = 2013-05-02 |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debian project is a volunteer organization with three foundational documents:
* The ''[[Debian Social Contract]]'' defines a set of basic principles by which the project and its developers conduct affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialcontract&quot; /&gt;
* The ''[[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]'' define the criteria for &quot;free software&quot; and thus what software is permissible in the distribution. These guidelines have been adopted as the basis of the [[The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]]. Although this document can be considered separate, it formally is part of the Social Contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialcontract&quot; /&gt;
* The ''Debian Constitution'' describes the organizational structure for formal decision-making within the project, and enumerates the powers and responsibilities of the Project Leader, the Secretary and other roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/devel/constitution |title = Constitution for the Debian Project (v1.4) |access-date = 2014-02-25 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debian developers are organized in a [[web of trust]].{{sfn |Coleman |2013 |p=143}} There are {{as of|2014|alt=at present}} about one thousand active Debian developers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nm.debian.org/public/people/dd_u |title = Debian New Member – Status DD, upl. |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nm.debian.org/public/people/dd_nu |title = Debian New Member – Status DD, non-upl. |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible to contribute to the project without being an official developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/intro/help |title = How can you help Debian? |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-04-30 |access-date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project maintains official [[mailing list]]s and conferences for communication and coordination between developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/ |title = Index of /pub/debian-meetings |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For issues with single packages and other tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/Bugs/pseudo-packages |title = Debian bug tracking system pseudo-packages |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-12-08 |access-date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a public [[Software bug|bug]] tracking system is used by developers and end users. [[Internet Relay Chat]] channels (primarily on the [[Open and Free Technology Community]] (OFTC) and [[freenode]] networks) are also used for communication among developers&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; and to provide real time help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/support#irc |title = Support |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-04-30 |access-date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debian is supported by donations made to organizations authorized by the leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot; /&gt; The largest supporter is [[Software in the Public Interest]], the owner of the Debian trademark, manager of the monetary donations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/donations |title = Donations to Software in the Public Interest |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-05-10 |access-date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[umbrella organization]] for various other community free software projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/ |title = SPI Associated Projects |publisher = [[Software in the Public Interest]] |date = 2014-07-14 |access-date = 2014-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Project Leader is elected once per year by the developers. The leader has special powers, but they are not absolute, and appoints delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot; /&gt; The voting method is based on the [[Schulze method]] (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).&lt;ref name=&quot;vote-info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/vote/ |title = Debian Voting Information |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-02-18 |access-date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project leadership is distributed occasionally. Branden Robinson was helped by the Project [[Scud (dog)|Scud]], a team of developers that assisted the leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html |title = Announcing project scud |last = van Wolffelaar |first = Jeroen |mailinglist = debian-project |publisher = Debian |date = 2005-03-05 |access-date = 2014-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were concerns that such leadership would split Debian into two developer classes.{{sfn |Krafft |2005 |p=34}} Anthony Towns created a supplemental position, Second In Charge (2IC), that shared some powers of the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00015.html |title = Bits from the DPL |last = Towns |first = Anthony |mailinglist = debian-devel-announce |publisher = Debian |date = 2006-04-23 |access-date = 2014-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve McIntyre was 2IC and had a 2IC himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/vote/2009/platforms/93sam |title = Steve McIntyre's DPL platform, 2009 |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important role in Debian's leadership is that of a [[software release life cycle|release]] manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.business.ualberta.ca/tcc/documents/TII_3_OMahoney_Ferraro_final.pdf |title = The Emergence of Governance in an Open Source Community |page = 30 |last1 = O'Mahony |first1 = Siobhán |last2 = Ferraro |first2 = Fabrizio |publisher = [[University of Alberta School of Business]] |access-date = 2008-11-01 |year = 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529081303/http://www.business.ualberta.ca/tcc/documents/TII_3_OMahoney_Ferraro_final.pdf |archivedate = 2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release team sets goals for the next release, supervises the processes and decides when to release. The team is led by the next release managers and stable release managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/intro/organization |title = The Debian organization web page |access-date = 2008-11-01 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Release assistants were introduced in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/03/msg00007.html |title = Bits from the RM: Help Wanted, Apply Within |last = Towns |first = Anthony |mailinglist = debian-devel-announce |publisher = Debian |date = 2003-03-08 |access-date = 2014-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developer recruitment, motivation, and resignation ===
The Debian project has an influx of applicants wishing to become developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nm.debian.org/public/stats/ |title = Debian New Member – Statistics |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-03 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140706180807/https://nm.debian.org/public/stats/ |archivedate = July 6, 2014 |df = mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These applicants must undergo a vetting process which establishes their identity, motivation, understanding of the project's principles, and technical competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint |title = Debian New Maintainers |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has become much harder throughout the years.{{sfn |Hertzog |2013 |p=13}}

Debian developers join the project for many reasons. Some that have been cited include:
* Debian is their main operating system and they want to promote Debian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2009/01/msg00022.html |title = AM report for Alexander GQ Gerasiov |last = Berg |first = Christoph |mailinglist = debian-newmaint |publisher = Debian |date = 2009-01-10 |access-date = 2014-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debian developers may resign their positions at any time or, when deemed necessary, they can be expelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot; /&gt; Those who follow the retiring protocol are granted the &quot;emeritus&quot; status and they may regain their membership through a shortened new member process.&lt;ref name=&quot;developer-duties&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/developer-duties.html |work = Debian Developer's Reference |title = Chapter 3.

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;Flowchart of the life cycle of a Debian package&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each software package has a ''maintainer'' that may be either one person or a team of Debian developers and non-developer maintainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html |work = Debian Policy Manual |title = Chapter 3 – Binary packages |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-10-28 |access-date = 2014-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/vote/2007/vote_003 |year = 2007 |access-date = 2008-12-13 |title = General Resolution: Endorse the concept of Debian Maintainers |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maintainer keeps track of [[upstream (software development)|upstream]] releases, and ensures that the package coheres with the rest of the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian. Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.&lt;ref name=&quot;developer-duties&quot; /&gt;

The maintainer releases a new version by uploading the package to the &quot;incoming&quot; system, which verifies the integrity of the packages and their [[digital signature]]s. If the package is found to be valid, it is installed in the package archive into an area called the &quot;pool&quot; and distributed every day to hundreds of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] worldwide. The upload must be signed using [[OpenPGP]]-compatible software.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; All Debian developers have individual [[Public-key cryptography|cryptographic key pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/new-maintainer.html#registering |access-date = 2010-10-09 |work = Debian Developer's Reference |title = Chapter 2. Applying to Become a Maintainer |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers are responsible for any package they upload even if the packaging was prepared by another contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq?action=recall&amp;rev=1#What.27s_a_sponsor.2C_why_do_I_want_one.2C_and_how_do_I_get_one.3F |title = DebianMentorsFaq |last = Costela |first = Leo |publisher = Debian Wiki |date = 2010-02-12 |access-date = 2014-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, an accepted package is only available in the ''unstable'' branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; For a package to become a candidate for the next release, it must migrate to the ''Testing'' branch by meeting the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.html#testing |access-date = 2008-10-31 |work = Debian Developer's Reference |title = Chapter 5. Managing Packages |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been in ''unstable'' for a certain length of time that depends on the urgency of the changes.
* It does not have &quot;release-critical&quot; bugs, except for the ones already present in ''Testing''. Release-critical bugs are those considered serious enough that they make the package unsuitable for release.
* There are no outdated versions in ''unstable'' for any release ports.
* The migration does not break any packages in ''Testing''.
* Its dependencies can be satisfied by packages already in ''Testing'' or by packages being migrated at the same time.
* The migration is not blocked by a freeze.

Thus, a release-critical bug in a new version of a shared library on which many packages depend may prevent those packages from entering ''Testing'', because the updated library must meet the requirements too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/devel/testing |access-date = 2008-11-24 |title = Debian 'testing' distribution |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the branch viewpoint, the migration process happens twice per day, rendering ''Testing'' in [[perpetual beta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt;

Periodically, the release team publishes guidelines to the developers in order to ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the ''Testing'' branch and any other significant issues are solved. At that time, all packages in the ''testing'' branch become the new ''stable'' branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt; Although freeze dates are time-based,&lt;ref name=&quot;two-year-cycle&quot; /&gt; release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers a couple of weeks beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/04/msg00006.html |title = FINAL release update |last = McGovern |first = Neil |mailinglist = debian-devel-announce |publisher = Debian |date = 2013-04-18 |access-date = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of a package can belong to more than one branch, usually ''testing'' and ''unstable''. It is possible for a package to keep the same version between stable releases and be part of ''oldstable'', ''stable'', ''testing'' and ''unstable'' at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=dict-bouvier |title = Debian – Package Search Results – dict-bouvier |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each branch can be seen as a collection of pointers into the package &quot;pool&quot; mentioned above.&lt;ref name=&quot;distributions&quot; /&gt;

=== Security ===
The Debian project handles security through [[Full disclosure (computer security)|public disclosure]] rather than through [[security through obscurity|obscurity]]. Debian security advisories are compatible with the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] dictionary, are usually coordinated with other free software vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/security/ |access-date = 2008-12-13 |title = Security Information |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://cve.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html#Software%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest,%20Inc. |title = Organizations Participating |publisher = [[Mitre Corporation|MITRE]] |date = 2014-04-16 |access-date = 2014-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There used to be a security audit project that focused on packages in the stable release looking for security bugs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/security/audit/ |title = Debian Security Audit Project |publisher = Debian |date = 2014-03-15 |access-date = 2014-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Kemp, who started the project, retired in 2011 but resumed his activities and applied to rejoin in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.steve.org.uk/Security/Advisories/ |title = Advisories |publisher = Steve Kemp |access-date = 2014-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nm.debian.org/public/person/skx |title = Steve Kemp |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2014-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''stable'' branch is supported by the Debian security team; ''oldstable'' is supported for one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;securityfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/security/faq |title = Debian security FAQ |date = 2007-02-28 |access-date = 2008-10-21 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Squeeze is not officially supported, Debian is coordinating an effort to provide [[long-term support]] (LTS) until February 2016, five years after the initial release, but only for the IA-32 and x86-64 platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTY2NzA |title = Debian To Maintain 6.0 Squeeze As An LTS Release |last = Larabel |first = Michael |authorlink = Michael Larabel |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2014-04-18 |access-date = 2014-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Testing'' is supported by the ''testing'' security team, but does not receive updates in as timely a manner as ''stable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://testing-security.debian.net |title = Debian testing security team |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2008-10-31 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081005233623/http://testing-security.debian.net/ |archivedate = October 5, 2008 |df = mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unstable''{{'}}s security is left for the package maintainers.&lt;ref name=&quot;securityfaq&quot; /&gt;

The Debian project offers documentation and tools to [[hardening (computing)|harden]] a Debian installation both manually and automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#securing |access-date = 2008-12-13 |title = Securing Debian Manual |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] and [[AppArmor]] support is available but disabled by default.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-in-lenny-arm&quot; /&gt; Debian provides an optional hardening wrapper, and does not harden all of its software by default using [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] features such as [[Position-independent code|PIE]] and [[buffer overflow protection]], unlike operating systems such as [[OpenBSD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://d-sbd.alioth.debian.org/www/ |title = Debian Secure by Default |publisher = Debian: SbD |access-date = 2011-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but tries to build as many packages as possible with hardening flags.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-in-7&quot; /&gt;

==== 2008 OpenSSL vulnerability ====
In May 2008, it was revealed that a Debian developer discovered that the [[OpenSSL]] package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a [[random number generator attack]], since only 32,767 different keys were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = //www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571 |title = DSA-1571-1 openssl: predictable random number generator |date = 2008-05-13 |access-date = 2008-10-31 |publisher = Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0166 |title = CVE-2008-0166 |access-date = 2014-07-21 |publisher = [[Mitre Corporation|MITRE]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garfinkel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/410159/alarming-open-source-security-holes/ |title = Alarming Open-Source Security Holes |last = Garfinkel |first = Simson |authorlink = Simson Garfinkel |publisher = [[MIT Technology Review]] |date = 2008-05-20 |access-date = 2014-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The security weakness was caused by changes made in 2006 by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;garfinkel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=363516 |title = valgrind-clean the RNG |publisher = Debian BTS |date = 2006-04-19 |access-date = 2014-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/debiankey.pdf |title = When Private Keys are Public: Results from the 2008 Debian OpenSSL Vulnerability |publisher = [[University of California, San Diego]] |year = 2009 |access-date = 2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost of development ==

The cost of developing all of the packages included in Debian 5.0 Lenny (323 million lines of code) has been estimated to be about {{US$|8 billion|link=yes}}, using one method based on the [[COCOMO]] model.&lt;ref name=&quot;measuring-lenny&quot; /&gt; {{As of|2016}}, Black Duck [[Open Hub]] estimates that the current [[codebase]] (74 million lines of code) would cost about {{US$|1.4 billion}} to develop, using a different method based on the same model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.openhub.net/p/debian/estimated_cost |title = Estimated Cost |publisher = Black Duck [[Open Hub]] |access-date = 2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://packages.debian.org/stable/ohcount |title = Package: ohcount (3.0.0-8 and others) |publisher = Debian |access-date = 2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
{{Main|Debian family}}Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions, and many [[Debian family|other distributions]] have been created from the Debian codebase, including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Knoppix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7651/ |title = The Five Distros That Changed Linux |last = Vaughan-Nichols |first = Steven J. |publisher = [[Linux Magazine]] |date = 2009-12-16 |access-date = 2013-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, [[DistroWatch]] lists 126 active Debian derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://distrowatch.com/search.php?ostype=All&amp;category=All&amp;origin=All&amp;basedon=Debian&amp;notbasedon=None&amp;desktop=All&amp;architecture=All&amp;status=Active |title = Based on Debian, status active |publisher = [[DistroWatch]] |access-date = 2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Debian project provides its derivatives with guidelines for best practices and encourages derivatives to merge their work back into Debian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines?action=recall&amp;rev=1 |title = Derivatives Guidelines |last = Halchenko |first = Yaroslav |publisher = Debian Wiki |date = 2010-12-21 |access-date = 2014-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Hertzog |2013 |p=429}}
